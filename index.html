      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This space arises from the need to find practical tools that help us to materialize concepts such as gratitude, trust in life, connection with the mystery and many other topics.

        From Vivir Agradecidos we feel the desire to offer a space where we can share in community our reflections on these topics, and that we can apply them to daily life in a very concrete way, in order to be fuller, healthier and more grateful people.
